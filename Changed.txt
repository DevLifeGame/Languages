It was created back in 1962 by a programmer named Steve Russell. The game ran on the DEC PDP-1 computer and consisted of two spaceships. The goal of the game was to avoid colliding with the star while trying to shoot the other ship with missiles. You didn't hurt yourself, but you will have to pay for some of the damage out of your own pocket. Fortunately, the museum has backups of this code and the first original disc is kept safe under lock and key."

After some time passed, you remembered about this mysterious object in a glass display case. You forgot to ask the staff what’s in there. It’s far too late for that now, but it might be a good excuse to visit this place again in the future."

You took beautiful photos and at the end jumped off the flying plane and fall freely to the ground for over 60 seconds! The feeling was some you’ve never experienced before. After landing on a parachute, your legs were trembling from excitement. You thank your instructor for giving you this unforgettable adventure."

You took beautiful photos and at the end jumped off the flying plane and fall freely to the ground for over 60 seconds! The feeling was some you’ve never experienced before. Unfortunately, during landing, you didn’t exactly follow the instructions from the person you were jumping with and you hit the ground with your foot. It twisted in a very weird way and you felt terrible pain. Of course, there was medical help on sight, so you got first aid quickly. However, this injury will require some time off work to heal and properly regenerate."
